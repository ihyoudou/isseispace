Lately, i decided to remake my homepage and move to somekind of jamstack page generator. I'm already using Jekyll on my blog, and was thinking of moving to jamstack on my homepage for some time, but i was not sure which page generator to pick.  
I was pretty happy with my Jekyll setup, but due to lack of knowledge about CI/CD at the time and using multiple computers to write posts, i found it pretty unconvinent to create content.
