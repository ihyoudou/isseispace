# What is Archivit?
Archivit is a application that can archive Reddit subreddits posts with comments.
It is fully open-source and free to use, you can find it on my github - [github.com/ihyoudou/archivit](https://github.com/ihyoudou/archivit)

# Usecase
Although i did this project mostly because i wanted to try out Laravel Livewire I do see some usecases.

* Archiving history, changes of subreddit
* Using the post data, images from posts for machine learning
* Gathering statistics
